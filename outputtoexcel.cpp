/* IN THIS SECTION WE WILL TAKE AN INPUT FROM THE USER AND WILL STORE IT IN THE EXCEL SHEET.
IT IS STATED THAT THIS SECTION IS ONLY TO MAKE A SKELETON TO STORE DATA IN THE EXCEL SHEET.
AND OF COURSE WE WILL UPDATE IT SOONER.
AGAIN I WILL SAY THAT I HAVE USED BASIC CONCEPTS TO CODE IT. 
BUT HERE WE ARE INTRODUCED WITH SOME NEW THINGS, WHICH YOU GUYS BETTER KNOWS.
IT IS STATED THAT NO OBJECT-ORIENTED CONCEPT WILL  BE USED IN THIS PROJECT. 
THIS CODE IS ONLY FOR 
1.UMER ZULFIQAR 
2.AMAN MIRZA
3.SUBHAN ALI 
4.WALEED IMRAN 
5.MUHAMMAD HASSAN
